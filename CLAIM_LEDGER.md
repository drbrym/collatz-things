# Claim ledger

This ledger is the authoritative index of mathematical claims in the
repository. If a note conflicts with this file, the note must be repaired
before its claim is used downstream.

| ID | Claim | Status | Source | Verification / dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BF1 | \(3(2^L-1)=\texttt{10}1^{L-2}\texttt{01}\) for \(L\ge2\) | Proved here | `Block_Fracture_Lemma.md` | `verify_block_fracture.py` |
| BF2 | In an isolated-block decomposition, positions \(k+2,\ldots,k+L-1\) of \(3n\) and \(3n+1\) are \(1\) | Proved here | `Block_Fracture_Lemma.md` | The guaranteed window may merge with neighbouring \(1\)-bits |
| BF3 | One odd-step sends \(M_L\) to \(\texttt{10}1^{L-1}\) | Proved here | `Block_Fracture_Lemma.md` | `verify_block_fracture.py` |
| RAIL1 | \(f(8y+1)=6y+1\), with strict descent for \(y\ge1\) | Proved here | `Mod8_Rail_Descent.md` | `verify_mod8_rails.py` |
| RAIL5 | \(f(8y+5)\le3y+2<8y+5\) | Proved here | `Mod8_Rail_Descent.md` | `verify_mod8_rails.py` |
| RAIL3 | The prescribed bridge \(8y+3\to12y+5\to9y+4\) is exact | Proved here | `Mod8_Rail_Descent.md` | It is a fixed-division bridge, not always two applications of \(f\) |
| RAIL7 | \(f^2(8y+7)=18y+17\), with stay depth \(\lfloor v_2(y+1)/2\rfloor\) | Proved here | `Mod8_Rail_Descent.md`, `collatz_rail7_new_results.md` | `verify_mod8_rails.py` |
| FIN1 | Every odd \(x\le10^6\) descends below itself within at most 111 odd-steps | Finite certificate | `Mod8_Rail_Descent.md` | `verify_mod8_rails.py` |
| RNG1 | No potential \(\log_2x+g(\tau(x))\) is globally nonincreasing for every odd \(x>1\) | Proved here | `recharge_nogo.md` | `verify_recharge_nogo.py` checks identities and the explicit contradiction |
| NLP1 | No potential \(\log_2 x + g(x \bmod 2^m, \tau(x))\) is nonincreasing along \(f\), for any \(m\ge0\) and any \(g\) | Proved here (pending final external literature check) | `no_local_potential.md` | `verify_no_local_potential.py`; generalizes RNG1 (the \(m=0\) case); depends on `recharge_nogo.md` Lemmas 1–2 |
| MER1 | The Mersenne burn is \(f^{(j)}(M_n)=3^j2^{n-j}-1\) through its closed-form phase | Proved here | `recharge_nogo.md` | `verify_recharge_nogo.py` |
| MER2 | \(f^{(n)}(M_n)=(3^n-1)/2^{v_2(3^n-1)}\) | Proved here | `mersenne_repunit_reduction.md` | `verify_repunit_reduction.py` |
| DEN1 | Almost every odd integer has finite stopping time, with the explicit bound stated in the note | Known theorem rederived | `stopping_time_density.md` | Terras/Everett; verifier checks finite instances of the ingredients |
| POT1 | The decayed-bit potential decreases on the explicit recharge family under the stated parameter bound | Proved here | `Exponential_Decay_Potential.md` | Proof uses a uniform ratio and fuel bound |
| POT2 | Epoch-potential descent for odd \(x\le10^6\) under \(c=r=0.2\) | Finite certificate | `Exponential_Decay_Potential.md` | `verify_exponential_potential.py` |
| CYC1 | A \(K\)-odd-step cycle satisfies \(x(2^{E_K}-3^K)=c_K\) | Proved here | `cycle_reduction.md` | `verify_cycle_reduction.py` checks the identity |
| CYC2 | The bounded valuation-pattern search implemented for \(K\le8\) finds only \(x=1\) | Finite certificate | `cycle_reduction.md` | Not exhaustive over unbounded \(E_K\) |
| CYC3 | Minima of nontrivial cycles have natural density zero | Conditional corollary | `cycle_reduction.md` | Depends on DEN1; does not imply the same for every cycle element |
| CYC4 | No nontrivial positive cycle has an element \(\le10^6\) | Finite certificate | `cycle_reduction.md` | Any such cycle would have a minimum \(\le10^6\), contradicting FIN1 |
| TREE1 | The all-ones residue anchors every tested descent-tree depth and has minimal initial valuations | Proved burn + finite tree certificate | `descent_tree_survivors.md` | `verify_tree_survivors.py` |
| TREE2 | Tree-survivor density is universally bounded by \(\rho^K\) | **Refuted** (exact computation; first failure \(K=195\)) | `descent_tree_survivors.md` | `verify_survivor_density_rate.py`; see COR1–COR2 for the correct rate |
| COR1 | \(\operatorname{dens}(\tilde S_K)\le31\,\rho^{K/\theta}\) for all \(K\ge1\) | Proved here | `corridor_rate.md` | `verify_corridor_rate.py` |
| COR2 | \(\lim \operatorname{dens}(\tilde S_K)^{1/K}=\rho^{1/\theta}=0.9659\ldots\) | Proved here | `corridor_rate.md` | DP rate convergence (finite evidence for the limit; proof is human) |
| COR3 | Undischarged-class count grows with branching factor \(2\rho^{1/\theta}=1.9318\ldots\) | Proved here (from COR1/2) | `corridor_rate.md` | Corollary 2 of `corridor_rate.md` |
| PAR1 | Two trajectories with nonzero offset cannot follow the same parity-rule sequence indefinitely | Known theorem rederived | `Collatz_Parity_Fragility_Corrected.md` | Terras 1976 / Everett 1977 parity-vector injectivity, restated for the C-map (k halvings in place of k T-steps); does not imply non-merging, repulsion, or absence of basins |

## Admission rule

A claim may be promoted to **Proved here** only when its quantifiers and domain
are explicit, the human proof covers all cases, its dependencies are already
proved, and any verifier tests the same statement without silently replacing a
universal quantifier by a finite range.
