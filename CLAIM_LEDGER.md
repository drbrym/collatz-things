## Archived documents

Superseded heuristics, legacy summaries, and their bounded artifacts are
listed in `archive/README.md`. They are retained for provenance and are not
dependencies of maintained claims.

## Admission rule

A claim may be promoted to **Proved here** only when its quantifiers and domain
are explicit, the human proof covers all cases, its dependencies are already
proved, and any verifier tests the same statement without silently replacing a
universal quantifier by a finite range.
