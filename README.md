# Some notes on The Collatz Conjecture

**Some ideas**

A structured, modern re-examination of the **3n+1 problem** using algebraic structure, parity dynamics, density analysis, and high-resolution computational experiments.

This repository contains a sequence of technical notes that build a coherent picture of *why* the Collatz map is so strongly biased toward collapse, and *why* non-trivial cycles and divergent trajectories appear to be structurally impossible — even though no complete proof yet exists.

All documents are designed to be:

- **mathematically clean**,
- **GitHub-renderable**,
- **modular**, and
- **non-overclaiming** (each states exactly what it proves).

> **2026 revision note.** Two things changed in this pass. First, the original "Algebraic Fracture" claim that a block of 1-bits is *annihilated* under $3n$ was **wrong**; it has been replaced by the exact **Block-Fracture Identity** ($3(2^L-1) = \texttt{10}\,1^{L-2}\,\texttt{01}$: the run contracts by two, it is not destroyed), with a full carry proof and a verifier. Second, a new exact note on **mod-8 rail descent** has been added. Every exact claim in the two new notes ships with a reproducible Python script and has been checked with zero exceptions.

# 📚 Document Overview

The notes split into two groups: **exact results** (theorems with proofs and verifiers) and **heuristic/structural arguments** (compelling but not proven). The 2026 revision sharpens this split.

## ⭐ Exact results (proved + machine-verified)

### A. Block-Fracture Identity  *(NEW / corrects the old Algebraic Fracture Lemma)*
📄 `Block_Fracture_Lemma.md` · 📄 `Block_Fracture_Lemma.pdf` · 🧪 `verify_block_fracture.py`

An exact, elementary description of what $\times 3$ does to a run of 1-bits:
- $3(2^L-1) = \texttt{10}\,1^{L-2}\,\texttt{01}$ — an isolated block of $L$ ones becomes a run of $L-2$ ones (it is **not** annihilated; weight is preserved at the multiply).
- A full **carry proof** (Lemma 2) shows the interior contraction is independent of surrounding bits.
- **Mersenne erosion:** one odd-step sends $2^L-1 \to \texttt{10}\,1^{L-1}$, so the leading run drops by exactly one.
- Stated limit: the *global* longest run is **not** bounded under $3x+1$ — the result is about isolated blocks only.

> Replaces the earlier `algebraic_fracture_proof.md`, whose "annihilation" claim was false.

### B. Mod-8 Rail Descent  *(NEW)*
📄 `Mod8_Rail_Descent.md` · 📄 `Mod8_Rail_Descent.pdf` · 🧪 `verify_mod8_rails.py`

Exact descent behaviour by residue class mod 8:
- $f(8y+1) = 6y+1$ (exact image; strict descent for $y \ge 1$).
- $f(8y+5) \le 3y+2 < 8y+5$ (immediate descent).
- $8y+3 \to 9y+4$ via an exact two-step affine bridge (holds for all integers).
- $8y+7$: a finite-escape recursion with cap $\lfloor v_2(y+1)/2 \rfloor$; the all-ones numbers $2^k-1$ are the unique uncapped class (handed off to the Block-Fracture note).
- **Machine-verified:** every odd $x \le 10^6$ descends within $\le 111$ odd-steps.
- Stated limit: the window-free (global) version is left open and is, in effect, equivalent to the conjecture.

### C. Parity Fragility & Instability
📄 `Collatz_Parity_Fragility_Corrected.md`

A rigorous dynamical result: trajectories from $n$ and $n+\delta$ ($\delta \neq 0$) must diverge; any cycle is **repelling**. Establishes **Lock 3** below.

## 🧩 Structural summary

### D. Triple Lock (Cycle Impossibility Architecture)  *(revised, honestly labeled)*
📄 `Triple_Lock_Revised.md`

Three independent barriers to non-trivial cycles:
1. **Arithmetic Lock** — most U/D patterns have no integer solution *(evidential, not universal)*.
2. **Parity Lock** — integer solutions ("ghost loops") violate parity *(verified on all tested cases)*.
3. **Stability Lock** — any hypothetical cycle is dynamically repelling *(theorem; constrains stability, not existence)*.

The revision marks each lock as *evidential* or *proven*, plugs in the corrected Block-Fracture Identity as supporting structure, and notes that Lock 3 bounds a cycle's stability, not its existence. The $n=28$ ghost-loop worked example ($C=364$, $G=13$) is verified exactly.

## 🌫️ Heuristic / structural arguments (compelling, not proven)

These describe the *macro picture* via density and probabilistic reasoning. They are evidential, not rigorous, and are labeled as such.

- 📄 `recharge_density_inverse_law.md` — only low-density states recharge; high density must burn down.
- 📄 `fusion_fracture_cycle.md` — the pulse–decay–reset rhythm of density.
- 📄 `refractory_period_barrier.md` — large fusion spikes can't reorganize before decay.

# 🔗 How the Documents Fit Together

- **Micro-scale (exact):** Block-Fracture Identity → high-density runs contract deterministically.
- **Residue-scale (exact):** Mod-8 Rail Descent → 3 of 4 rails descend or bridge exactly; the 4th escapes in finite time.
- **Medium/macro-scale (heuristic):** Recharge / Fusion–Fracture / Refractory → why density can't grow indefinitely.
- **Cycle architecture:** Triple Lock + Parity Fragility → cycles are arithmetically rare, parity-forbidden, and dynamically unstable.

# 🧭 Suggested Reading Order

1. **Block-Fracture Identity** (exact, micro-scale)
2. **Mod-8 Rail Descent** (exact, residue-scale)
3. **Parity Fragility (Corrected)** (exact, dynamical)
4. **Triple Lock (Revised)** (structural summary)
5. Recharge / Fusion–Fracture / Refractory (heuristic macro picture)

# 🧪 Reproducing the exact results

```bash
python3 verify_block_fracture.py   # Block-Fracture Identity + Mersenne erosion
python3 verify_mod8_rails.py       # Mod-8 rail lemmas + finite-window check to 1e6
```

Both use exact integer arithmetic, need no dependencies, and print PASS for every claim (the mod-8 script's $10^6$ sweep takes a little longer).

# 📌 About This Project

This project aims to separate *rigorous results* from *heuristic arguments*, create clean modular papers suitable for GitHub and peer review, avoid past overclaims, and unify algebraic, probabilistic, and computational insights.

It does **not** claim a proof of the Collatz conjecture. It presents a *structural explanation* of why the conjecture appears true, with the exact/heuristic boundary drawn explicitly.
