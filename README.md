# Collatz structural notes

This repository studies the accelerated odd Collatz map

\[
f(x)=\frac{3x+1}{2^{v_2(3x+1)}}\qquad(x\text{ odd}).
\]

It does **not** contain a proof of the Collatz conjecture. Its maintained
results are a mixture of exact identities, no-go theorems for
potential-function methods, a rederivation of known density theorems, an
exact survivor-density rate theorem, bounded computational certificates,
and explicitly labelled proof targets.

Start with:

- [`NOTATION.md`](NOTATION.md) for the canonical map and symbols.
- [`CLAIM_LEDGER.md`](CLAIM_LEDGER.md) for the authoritative status of every
  maintained claim.
- [`mersenne_obstructions.tex`](mersenne_obstructions.tex) — the
  consolidated manuscript *No-Go Theorems for One-Step Lyapunov Potentials
  for the 3x+1 Map* (Theorems A–D below), with compiled PDF.

## Proved-results track

### No-go theorems for one-step potentials

- [`shadow_certificate.md`](shadow_certificate.md)
  **(SH1, master theorem).** Shadowing the expanding rational cycle
  \(-5\mapsto-7\) at positive integers \(x\equiv-5\bmod 2^N\) proves: no
  potential \(\log_2x+g(x\bmod2^m,\,\tau,\,\mathrm{len},\,
  \lambda_1..\lambda_d)\) is nonincreasing, for any modulus, any detector
  depths, and any \(g\). Smallest certificate:
  \(1275\mapsto1913\mapsto1435\). General principle: every expanding
  rational cycle (\(2^E<3^K\)) is a certificate factory.
- [`leading_digit_nogo.md`](leading_digit_nogo.md)
  **(SH2).** Iterating the shadow and applying Dirichlet approximation to
  \(\log_2\frac98\) extends the exclusion to corrections using any fixed
  number of leading binary digits.
- [`spine_synthesis.md`](spine_synthesis.md)
  **(BND1).** No potential \(\log_2x+G(x)\) with bounded \(G\), of
  arbitrary dependence, is nonincreasing (one paragraph from the Mersenne
  burn). Also **(SPN1)**: the complete exact lane — tower \(\to\) Mersenne
  \(\to\) burn \(\to\) repunit, length \(d+M+1\), with exact payout
  \(e^\star=2+v_2(1+3^{d-1}s)\); every tower member lies on rail \(8y+1\).
- [`no_local_potential.md`](no_local_potential.md) **(NLP1)** and
  [`nlp2_alternation.md`](nlp2_alternation.md) **(NLP2)** — the original
  family-method proofs (burn/recharge scissors) for the residue-and-fuel
  subclasses. Subsumed by SH1 as impossibility statements; retained for
  the exact price mechanism (each detector level costs a would-be
  potential exactly \(\log_2\frac43\) against an unbounded liability) and
  the historical proof path.
- [`fuel_fraction_nogo.md`](fuel_fraction_nogo.md) **(FFN1)** — the
  \((\tau,\mathrm{len})\) class by explicit 11-witness certificate.
  Subsumed by SH1; retained for the certificate method exposition.
- [`verify_nogo_certificate.py`](verify_nogo_certificate.py) — logically
  independent verification: no-go constraint systems on finite coordinate
  windows are difference-constraint systems, infeasible iff the coordinate
  graph of raw orbit steps contains a cycle of ratio-product \(>1\);
  Bellman–Ford mining plus exact rational confirmation.

The surviving one-step class reads the quantized full logarithm
\(\lfloor2^j\log_2x\rfloor\); see the manuscript's boundary section. This
is where the no-go program terminates.

### The Mersenne ancestry tower

- [`tower_theorem.md`](tower_theorem.md)
  **(TWR1).** For every depth \(d\) and \(M\equiv1\bmod 2\cdot3^{d-1}\),
  \(w_d(M)=(2^{M+2d}-2^{2d+1}+3^d)/3^d\) satisfies
  \(f^d(w_d(M))=2^M-1\) with every step an \(e{=}2\) step; exact
  carry-free periodic binary normal form of period \(2\cdot3^{d-1}\)
  (via LTE); frozen 2-adic tails separating at bit \(2\min(d,d')+1\).
  Resolves the hierarchy conjecture of
  [`latent_fuel_notes.md`](latent_fuel_notes.md). Also **(NLPD)**, the
  unconditional detector no-go, now subsumed by SH1.

### Binary and residue structure

- [`Block_Fracture_Lemma.md`](Block_Fracture_Lemma.md)
  proves \(3(2^L-1)=\texttt{10}1^{L-2}\texttt{01}\), a protected interior
  consecutive-one window for an isolated block, and the exact first
  odd-step from a Mersenne number.
- [`Mod8_Rail_Descent.md`](Mod8_Rail_Descent.md)
  proves immediate descent on residues \(1\) and \(5\bmod8\), an exact
  fixed-division bridge on residue \(3\bmod8\), and the finite rail-\(7\)
  stay recursion.
- [`collatz_rail7_new_results.md`](collatz_rail7_new_results.md)
  gives the closed form for the rail-\(7\) recursion and its
  Mersenne-index escape formulas.

### Mersenne structure

- [`recharge_nogo.md`](recharge_nogo.md)
  proves the original \(\log_2x+g(v_2(x+1))\) no-go (now subsumed by SH1)
  and derives the exact Mersenne burn ledger. Attribution: the iterated
  burn identity \(2^tu-1\to3^tu-1\) is recorded by Andaloro (Fibonacci
  Quart. 38 (2000) 73–78); the coordinate-freezing use is this
  repository's.
- [`mersenne_repunit_reduction.md`](mersenne_repunit_reduction.md)
  reduces the Mersenne trajectory after its closed-form burn to the
  base-\(3\) repunit \((3^n-1)/2\) for odd \(n\).
- [`Exponential_Decay_Potential.md`](Exponential_Decay_Potential.md)
  proves descent of a bounded bit-weight potential on one explicit
  recharge family. Its global failure is now a theorem (BND1), not just
  an admission.

### Density and cycles

- [`corridor_rate.md`](corridor_rate.md)
  **(COR1–COR3).** The exact survivor-density rate: the density of odd
  integers not discharged by a \(K\)-bit valuation budget satisfies
  \(\lim p_K^{1/K}=\rho^{1/\theta}=0.965907\ldots\), with the explicit
  bound \(p_K\le31\,\rho^{K/\theta}\); consequently any finite-modulus
  forced-descent tree prover faces an undischarged frontier growing with
  branching factor exactly \(2\rho^{1/\theta}=1.9318\ldots\). Supersedes
  the refuted conjecture of `descent_tree_survivors.md`.
- [`stopping_time_density.md`](stopping_time_density.md)
  gives a self-contained rederivation of the Terras/Everett
  almost-everywhere finite-stopping-time theorem with an explicit
  geometric bound. Known theorem, not a new resolution of the exceptional
  set.
- [`cycle_reduction.md`](cycle_reduction.md)
  proves the affine cycle equation and records carefully bounded finite
  searches. It does not exclude all nontrivial cycles; convergence is
  computationally verified in the literature to \(\sim2^{68}\) (Barina),
  which dominates the bounded searches here.

## Finite certificates

The following statements are exhaustive only over their stated bounds:

- Every odd \(x\le10^6\) descends below itself within at most 111
  odd-steps.
- The decayed-bit potential decreases across every tested first-descent
  epoch for odd \(x\le10^6\) with \(c=r=0.2\).
- The bounded cycle-pattern search documented in `cycle_reduction.md`
  finds only \(x=1\).
- The measured descent-tree survivor fractions satisfy \(\le\rho^K\) for
  \(6\le K\le20\) **only**; the universal \(\rho^K\) bound is refuted
  (first failure \(K=195\), `verify_survivor_density_rate.py`), and the
  correct asymptotic rate is \(\rho^{1/\theta}\) (COR2).
- Mined no-go certificates cover the tested coordinate windows over odd
  \(x\le2\cdot10^6\); the uniform theorems are carried by the shadow
  families, not by the mining.

## Proof targets and exploratory work

These documents are useful research records but are not dependencies of
the proved-results track:

- [`descent_tree_survivors.md`](descent_tree_survivors.md) — exact spine
  anchor; its original Conjecture 1 is **refuted** and superseded by
  COR1–COR3.
- [`latent_fuel_notes.md`](latent_fuel_notes.md) — discovery path for the
  tower; its hierarchy conjecture is **resolved** by TWR1.
- [`repunit_tail_attack.md`](repunit_tail_attack.md) and related repunit
  automaton/normal-form notes. The open residual \(\sigma(a_n)\) after
  the repunit landing is unchanged by all of the above.
- [`fuse_map_theory.md`](fuse_map_theory.md) and
  [`fuse_burn_attack.md`](fuse_burn_attack.md).
- [`fusion_fracture_cycle.md`](fusion_fracture_cycle.md),
  [`refractory_period_barrier.md`](refractory_period_barrier.md), and
  [`recharge_density_inverse_law.md`](recharge_density_inverse_law.md).
- [`Triple_Lock.md`](Triple_Lock.md) and
  [`Triple_Lock_Revised.md`](Triple_Lock_Revised.md).
- [`potential_attack_notes.md`](potential_attack_notes.md) — the
  paired-macro program; note (SPN1) that macro net drift reduces to
  \(\sigma(a_M)\).

The parity-itinerary note
[`Collatz_Parity_Fragility_Corrected.md`](Collatz_Parity_Fragility_Corrected.md)
is a rederivation of Terras (1976) / Everett (1977) parity-vector
injectivity, restated for the unaccelerated map. It does **not** prove
that trajectories cannot later merge, or that hypothetical cycles are
metrically repelling.

## Verification

All programs use the Python standard library; every assertion is exact
integer or rational arithmetic.

```bash
# no-go program
python verify_shadow.py
python verify_leading_digit.py
python verify_tower.py
python verify_no_local_potential.py
python verify_nlp2.py
python verify_fuel_fraction.py
python verify_nogo_certificate.py
python verify_spine_synthesis.py

# density and rates
python verify_corridor_rate.py
python verify_survivor_density_rate.py
python verify_stopping_density.py
python verify_tree_survivors.py

# structure, cycles, legacy
python verify_block_fracture.py
python verify_mod8_rails.py
python verify_recharge_nogo.py
python verify_exponential_potential.py
python verify_repunit_reduction.py
python verify_cycle_reduction.py
```

Interpret the output according to the claim ledger:

- symbolic identities and human proofs support universal claims;
- exhaustive loops support only their printed finite ranges;
- random sampling and `explore_*.py` output are evidence, not proofs;
- mined certificates prove infeasibility on their exact coordinate
  window; uniform statements require the designed families.

## Correction history (standard, not embarrassment)

- The universal survivor bound \(\rho^K\) (TREE2) was refuted by exact
  computation at \(K=195\) after passing its \(K\le20\) certificate; the
  corrected rate \(\rho^{1/\theta}\) is now a theorem (COR1–COR2).
- The parity-fragility theorem was reclassified as a rederivation of
  Terras/Everett after a literature pass.
- A draft of SPN1 overclaimed \(M\equiv1\bmod4\) uniformly; refuted by
  its verifier at \((d,s)=(1,1)\) and corrected before promotion.
- NLP1/NLP2/NLPD/FFN1 were superseded as impossibility statements by the
  strictly stronger and simpler SH1 within the same research arc; their
  structural content is retained.

## Contribution standard

A universal statement belongs in the proved-results track only when:

- its domain and quantifiers are explicit;
- the proof covers all edge cases;
- every dependency is already proved;
- the verifier tests the same claim the prose states;
- finite experiments are not used to replace an unbounded argument;
- the note states exactly what remains open.
